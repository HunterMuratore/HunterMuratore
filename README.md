Full-Stack Developer
--------------------

I am a dedicated full-stack developer with a unique background in inorganic chemistry. Having transitioned from an R&D specialist role at Air Liquide in 2020 and 2021, I embarked on a transformative journey into the world of software development.

💻 After a year of independent learning and a deep dive into the Rutgers Full-Stack Bootcamp, I've evolved into a proficient and adept full-stack developer. My extensive background in inorganic chemistry enhances my problem-solving skills, providing a unique perspective in crafting efficient and innovative code.

🚀 My GitHub is a reflection of my commitment to quality code and continuous improvement. I've successfully developed several full-stack applications, showcasing my prowess in both front-end and back-end technologies. From concept to deployment, I thrive on turning ideas into functional and user-friendly solutions.

📚 Always hungry for knowledge, I stay ahead of the curve by exploring new technologies and embracing challenges that push my boundaries. Let's collaborate on projects that merge technical expertise with a touch of scientific flair.

Happy coding! 🌐🚀
